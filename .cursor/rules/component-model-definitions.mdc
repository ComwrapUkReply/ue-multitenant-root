# Content modeling for AEM authoring projects

Learn how content modeling works for projects using AEM authoring as a content source and how to model your own content.

## Prerequisites

Projects using AEM authoring as a content source inherit the majority of the mechanics of any other Edge Delivery Services project, independent of the content source or authoring method.

Before you begin modeling content for your project, make sure you first read the following documentation.

* Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial
* Markup, Sections, Blocks, and Auto Blocking
* Block Collection

It is essential to understand those concepts in order to create a compelling content model that works in a content source-agnostic way. This document provides details about the mechanics implemented specifically for AEM authoring.

## Default content

**Default content** is content an author intuitively would put on a page without adding any additional semantics. This includes text, headings, links, and images. Such content is self-explanatory in its function and purpose.

In AEM, this content is implemented as components with very simple, pre-defined models, which include everything that can be serialized in Markdown and HTML.

* **Text**: Rich text (including list elements and strong or italic text)
* **Title**: Text, type (h1-h6)
* **Image**: Source, description
* **Button**: Text, title, url, type (default, primary, secondary)

The model of these components is part of the boilerplate for projects with AEM authoring as the content source.

## Blocks

Blocks are used to create richer content with specific styles and functionality. In contrast to default content, blocks do require additional semantics.

Blocks are essentially pieces of content decorated by JavaScript and styled with a stylesheet.

### Block model definition

When using AEM authoring as your content source, the content of blocks must be modelled explicitly in order to provide the author the interface to create content. Essentially you need to create a model so the authoring UI knows what options to present to the author based on the block.

The `component-models.json` file defines the model of blocks. The fields defined in the component model are persisted as properties in AEM and rendered as cells in the table that makes up a block.

```json
{
  "id": "hero",
  "fields": [
    {
      "component": "reference",
      "valueType": "string",
      "name": "image",
      "label": "Image",
      "multi": false
    },
    {
      "component": "text-input",
      "valueType": "string",
      "name": "imageAlt",
      "label": "Alt",
      "value": ""
    },
    {
      "component": "text-area",
      "name": "text",
      "value": "",
      "label": "Text",
      "valueType": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that not every block must have a model. Some blocks are simply containers for a list of children, where each child has its own model.

It is also necessary to define which blocks exist and can be added to a page using the Universal Editor. The `component-definitions.json` file lists the components as they are made available by the Universal Editor.

```json
{
  "title": "Hero",
  "id": "hero",
  "plugins": {
    "xwalk": {
      "page": {
        "resourceType": "core/franklin/components/block/v1/block",
        "template": {
          "name": "Hero",
          "model": "hero"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It is possible to use one model for many blocks. For example, some blocks may share a model that defines a text and image.

For each block, the developer:

* Must use the `core/franklin/components/block/v1/block` resource type, the generic implementation of the block logic in AEM.
* Must define the block name, which will be rendered in the block's table header.  
   * The block name is used to fetch the right style and script to decorate the block.
* Can define a model ID.  
   * The model ID is a reference to the component's model, which defines the fields available to the author in the properties panel.
* Can define a filter ID.  
   * The filter ID is a reference to the component's filter, which allows to change the authoring behavior, for example by limiting which children can be added to the block or section, or which RTE features are enabled.

All of this information is stored in AEM when a block is added to a page. If either the resource type or block name are missing, the block will not render on the page.

**WARNING**: While possible, it is not necessary or recommended to implement custom AEM components. The components for Edge Delivery Services provided by AEM are sufficient and offer certain guard rails to ease development.

The components provided by AEM render a markup that can be consumed by helix-html2md when publishing to Edge Delivery Services and by `aem.js` when loading a page in the Universal Editor. The markup is the stable contract between AEM and the other parts of the system, and does not allow for customizations. For this reason, projects must not change the components and must not use custom components.

### Block structure

The properties of blocks are defined in the component models and persisted as such in AEM. Properties are rendered as cells in the block's table-like structure.

### Simple blocks

In the simplest form, a block renders each property in a single row/column in the order the properties are defined in the model.

In the following example, the image is defined first in the model and the text second. They are thus rendered with the image first and text second.

With this data:

```json
{
  "name": "Hero",
  "model": "hero",
  "image": "/content/dam/image.png",
  "imageAlt": "Helix - a shape like a corkscrew",
  "text": "<h1>Welcome to AEM</h1>"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="hero">
  <div>
    <div>
      <picture>
        <img src="/content/dam/image.png" alt="Helix - a shape like a corkscrew">
      </picture>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to AEM</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And it will be turned into this table representation:

```
+---------------------------------------------+
| Hero                                        |
+=============================================+
| ![Helix - a shape like a corkscrew][image0] |
+---------------------------------------------+
| # Welcome to AEM                            |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

You may notice that some types of values allow inferring semantics in the markup, and properties are combined into single cells. This behavior is described in the section Type inference.

### Key-value block

In many cases, it is recommended to decorate the rendered semantic markup, add CSS class names, add new nodes or move them around in the DOM, and apply styles.

In other cases however, the block is read as a key-value pair-like configuration.

An example of this is the section metadata. In this use case, the block can be configured to render as a key-value pair table. Please see the section Sections and Section Metadata for more information.

With this data:

```json
{
  "name": "Featured Articles",
  "model": "spreadsheet-input",
  "key-value": true,
  "source": "/content/site/articles.json",
  "keywords": ['Developer','Courses'],
  "limit": 4
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="featured-articles">
  <div>
    <div>source</div>
    <div><a href="/content/site/articles.json">/content/site/articles.json</a></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>keywords</div>
    <div>Developer,Courses</div>
  <div>
  <div>
    <div>limit</div>
    <div>4</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And it will be turned into this table representation:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Featured Articles                                                     |
+=======================================================================+
| source   | [/content/site/articles.json](/content/site/articles.json) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| keywords | Developer,Courses                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| limit    | 4                                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Container blocks

Both of the previous structures have a single dimension: the list of properties. Container blocks allow adding children (usually of the same type or model) and hence are two-dimensional. These blocks still support their own properties rendered as rows with a single column first. But they also allow adding children, which are rendered as additional rows.

Container blocks are defined in the same way as simple blocks, but they also define a filter ID. The filter ID references a filter definition in the `component-filters.json` file, which lists the components that can be added as children to the container.

```json
{
  "id": "cards",
  "components": [
    "card"
  ]
}
```

The following example shows a cards container block that can contain card children.

With this data:

```json
{
  "name": "Cards",
  "model": "cards",
  "filter": "cards",
  "title": "Featured Products",
  "card1": {
    "name": "Card",
    "model": "card",
    "image": "/content/dam/card1.png",
    "title": "Product 1",
    "description": "Description of product 1"
  },
  "card2": {
    "name": "Card",
    "model": "card",
    "image": "/content/dam/card2.png",
    "title": "Product 2",
    "description": "Description of product 2"
  }
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="cards">
  <div>
    <div>Featured Products</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <picture>
        <img src="/content/dam/card1.png" alt="">
      </picture>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Product 1</h3>
      <p>Description of product 1</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <picture>
        <img src="/content/dam/card2.png" alt="">
      </picture>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Product 2</h3>
      <p>Description of product 2</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And it will be turned into this table representation:

```
+---------------------------------------------+
| Cards                                       |
+=============================================+
| Featured Products                           |
+---------------------------------------------+
| ![][image0] | ### Product 1                |
|             | Description of product 1     |
+---------------------------------------------+
| ![][image1] | ### Product 2                |
|             | Description of product 2     |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

## Type inference

The system can infer the semantic meaning of certain types of values and render them accordingly. This allows for a more intuitive authoring experience and reduces the need for complex field definitions.

### Images

When a field contains a reference to an asset with the MIME type `image/*`, it is automatically rendered as a `<picture>` element with an `<img>` tag.

With this data:

```json
{
  "image": "/content/dam/hero-image.png",
  "imageAlt": "Hero image description"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<picture>
  <img src="/content/dam/hero-image.png" alt="Hero image description">
</picture>
```

### Links

When a field contains a URL or reference, it is automatically rendered as an `<a>` tag.

With this data:

```json
{
  "link": "https://www.adobe.com",
  "linkText": "Visit Adobe",
  "linkTitle": "Navigate to adobe.com"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<a href="https://www.adobe.com" title="Navigate to adobe.com">Visit Adobe</a>
```

### Rich text

When a field contains content that starts with block elements (like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<ul>`, etc.), it is automatically rendered as semantic HTML.

With this data:

```json
{
  "text": "<p>This is a paragraph with <strong>bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em>.</p>"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph with <strong>bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em>.</p>
```

### Classes

The `classes` property is a special property that can be used to specify CSS classes for the block. These classes are applied to the block element and can be used for styling variants.

With this data:

```json
{
  "name": "Hero",
  "model": "hero",
  "classes": "variant-primary full-width",
  "title": "Welcome to AEM"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="hero variant-primary full-width">
  <div>
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to AEM</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Field collapse

Field collapse is a mechanism that allows multiple related fields to be combined into a single semantic element. This is particularly useful for creating complex content structures while maintaining a simple authoring interface.

### Links

When multiple fields are related to a link (URL, text, title, type), they can be collapsed into a single link element.

With this data:

```json
{
  "link": "https://www.adobe.com",
  "linkText": "Visit Adobe",
  "linkTitle": "Navigate to adobe.com",
  "linkType": "primary"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<strong><a href="https://www.adobe.com" title="Navigate to adobe.com">Visit Adobe</a></strong>
```

The system automatically combines the fields based on their naming convention:
- `link` - the URL
- `linkText` - the display text
- `linkTitle` - the title attribute
- `linkType` - the type (affects styling)

### Headings

With this data:

```json
{
  "heading": "Getting started",
  "headingType": "h2"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<h2>Getting started</h2>
```

### Element grouping

While field collapse is about combining multiple properties into a single semantic element, element grouping is about concatenating multiple semantic elements into a single cell. This is particularly helpful for use cases where the author should be restricted in the type and number of elements that they can create.

For example, a teaser component may allow the author to only create a subtitle, title, and a single paragraph description combined with a maximum of two call-to-action buttons. Grouping these elements together yields a semantic markup that can be styled without further action.

Element grouping uses a naming convention, where the group name is separated from each property in the group by an underscore. Field collapse of the properties in a group works as previously described.

If you add a group and there is already a field that has the group name, the field will become part of the group as well, so that element grouping can be added to blocks that didn't previously use it, without having to migrate content.

With this data:

```json
{
  "name": "teaser",
  "model": "teaser",
  "image": "/content/dam/teaser-background.png",
  "imageAlt": "A group of people sitting on a stage",
  "teaserText_subtitle": "Adobe Experience Cloud",
  "teaserText_title": "Meet the Experts",
  "teaserText_titleType": "h2",
  "teaserText_description": "<p>Join us in this ask me everything session...</p>",
  "teaserText_cta1": "https://link.to/more-details",
  "teaserText_cta1Text": "More Details",
  "teaserText_cta2": "https://link.to/sign-up",
  "teaserText_cta2Text": "RSVP",
  "teaserText_cta2Type": "primary"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="teaser">
  <div>
    <div>
      <picture>
        <img src="/content/dam/teaser-background.png" alt="A group of people sitting on a stage">
      </picture>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <p>Adobe Experience Cloud</p>
      <h2>Meet the Experts</h2>
      <p>Join us in this ask me everything session ...</p>
      <p><a href="https://link.to/more-details">More Details</a></p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://link.to/sign-up">RSVP</a></strong></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And it will be turned into this table representation:

```
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Teaser                                          |
+=================================================+
| ![A group of people sitting on a stage][image0] |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Adobe Experience Cloud                          |
| ## Meet the Experts                             |
| Join us in this ask me everything session ...   |
| [More Details](https://link.to/more-details)    |
| [RSVP](https://link.to/sign-up)                 |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

### Element Grouping for Block Options

As previously described, the `classes` property can be used to specify the block options of a block and children in a container block. Usually a select or multiselect field is used to author the block options as a single field. However, if there are multiple options and if some of them are mutually exclusive, it is easier for authors to use multiple fields to select from for individual block options. This is possible using the element grouping naming convention as described previously.

With the data:

```json
{
  "name": "teaser",
  "model": "teaser",
  "classes": "variant-a",
  "classes_background": "light",
  "classes_fullwidth": true
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="teaser variant-a light fullwidth">
  ...
</div>
```

Each field in the `classes` group can be text, an array of texts, or a boolean. In the example above, fields with a boolean value are handled slightly differently than fields with texts. For a boolean field, the property name excluding the classes group name will be added as a block option. This is particularly helpful when a toggle is used to turn a block option on or off.

## Sections and section metadata

The same way a developer can define and model multiple blocks, they can define different sections.

The content model of Edge Delivery Services deliberately allows only a single level of nesting, which is any default content or block contained by a section. This means in order to have more complex visual components that can contain other components, they have to be modelled as sections and combined together using auto-blocking client side. Typical examples of this are tabs and collapsible sections like accordions.

A section can be defined in the same way as a block, but with the resource type of `core/franklin/components/section/v1/section`. Sections can have a name and a filter ID, which are used by the Universal Editor only, as well as a model ID, which is used to render the section metadata. The model is in this way the model of the section metadata block, which will automatically be appended to a section as a key-value block if it is not empty.

The model ID and filter ID of the default section is section. It can be used to alter the behavior of the default section. The following example adds some styles and a background image to the section metadata model.

```json
{
  "id": "section",
  "fields": [
    {
      "component": "multiselect",
      "name": "style",
      "value": "",
      "label": "Style",
      "valueType": "string",
      "options": [
        {
          "name": "Fade in Background",
          "value": "fade-in"
        },
        {
          "name": "Highlight",
          "value": "highlight"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component": "reference",
      "valueType": "string",
      "name": "background",
      "label": "Image",
      "multi": false
    }
  ]
}
```

The following example defines a tab section, which can be used to create a tabs block by combining consecutive sections with a tab title data attribute into a tabs block during auto-blocking.

```json
{
  "title": "Tab",
  "id": "tab",
  "plugins": {
    "xwalk": {
      "page": {
        "resourceType": "core/franklin/components/section/v1/section",
        "template": {
          "name": "Tab",
          "model": "tab",
          "filter": "section"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Page metadata

Documents can have a page metadata block, which is used to define which `<meta>` elements are rendered in the `<head>` of a page. The page properties of pages in AEM as a Cloud Service map to those that are available out-of-the-box for Edge Delivery Services, like `title`, `description`, `keywords`, etc.

Before further exploring how to define your own metadata, please review the following documents to understand the concept of page metadata first.

* Metadata
* Bulk metadata

It is also possible to define additional page metadata in two ways.

### Metadata spreadsheets

It is possible to define metadata on a per path or per path pattern basis in a table-like way in AEM as a Cloud Service. There is an authoring UI for table-like data available that is similar to Excel or Google Sheets.

For further details, please see the document Using Spreadsheets to Manage Tabular Data for more information.

### Page properties

Many of the default page properties available in AEM are mapped to the respective page metadata in a document. That includes for example `title`, `description`, `robots`, `canonical` `url` or `keywords`. Some AEM-specific properties are available as well:

* `cq:lastModified` as modified-time in ISO8601 format
* The time the document was last published as `published-time` in ISO8601 format
* `cq:tags` as `cq-tags` as a comma-separated list of the tag IDs.

It is also possible to define a component model for custom page metadata, which will be made available to the author in the Universal Editor.

To do so, create a component model with the ID page-metadata.

```json
{
  "id": "page-metadata",
  "fields": [
    {
      "component": "text",
      "name": "theme",
      "label": "Theme"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also create component models per template. To do so, create entries named `<template>-metadata`, with `template` being the value stored in the template metadata property. For details on metadata, please see the document Metadata Block.
# Content modeling for AEM authoring projects

Learn how content modeling works for projects using AEM authoring as a content source and how to model your own content.

## Prerequisites

Projects using AEM authoring as a content source inherit the majority of the mechanics of any other Edge Delivery Services project, independent of the content source or authoring method.

Before you begin modeling content for your project, make sure you first read the following documentation.

* Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial
* Markup, Sections, Blocks, and Auto Blocking
* Block Collection

It is essential to understand those concepts in order to create a compelling content model that works in a content source-agnostic way. This document provides details about the mechanics implemented specifically for AEM authoring.

## Default content

**Default content** is content an author intuitively would put on a page without adding any additional semantics. This includes text, headings, links, and images. Such content is self-explanatory in its function and purpose.

In AEM, this content is implemented as components with very simple, pre-defined models, which include everything that can be serialized in Markdown and HTML.

* **Text**: Rich text (including list elements and strong or italic text)
* **Title**: Text, type (h1-h6)
* **Image**: Source, description
* **Button**: Text, title, url, type (default, primary, secondary)

The model of these components is part of the boilerplate for projects with AEM authoring as the content source.

## Blocks

Blocks are used to create richer content with specific styles and functionality. In contrast to default content, blocks do require additional semantics.

Blocks are essentially pieces of content decorated by JavaScript and styled with a stylesheet.

### Block model definition

When using AEM authoring as your content source, the content of blocks must be modelled explicitly in order to provide the author the interface to create content. Essentially you need to create a model so the authoring UI knows what options to present to the author based on the block.

The `component-models.json` file defines the model of blocks. The fields defined in the component model are persisted as properties in AEM and rendered as cells in the table that makes up a block.

```json
{
  "id": "hero",
  "fields": [
    {
      "component": "reference",
      "valueType": "string",
      "name": "image",
      "label": "Image",
      "multi": false
    },
    {
      "component": "text-input",
      "valueType": "string",
      "name": "imageAlt",
      "label": "Alt",
      "value": ""
    },
    {
      "component": "text-area",
      "name": "text",
      "value": "",
      "label": "Text",
      "valueType": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that not every block must have a model. Some blocks are simply containers for a list of children, where each child has its own model.

It is also necessary to define which blocks exist and can be added to a page using the Universal Editor. The `component-definitions.json` file lists the components as they are made available by the Universal Editor.

```json
{
  "title": "Hero",
  "id": "hero",
  "plugins": {
    "xwalk": {
      "page": {
        "resourceType": "core/franklin/components/block/v1/block",
        "template": {
          "name": "Hero",
          "model": "hero"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It is possible to use one model for many blocks. For example, some blocks may share a model that defines a text and image.

For each block, the developer:

* Must use the `core/franklin/components/block/v1/block` resource type, the generic implementation of the block logic in AEM.
* Must define the block name, which will be rendered in the block's table header.  
   * The block name is used to fetch the right style and script to decorate the block.
* Can define a model ID.  
   * The model ID is a reference to the component's model, which defines the fields available to the author in the properties panel.
* Can define a filter ID.  
   * The filter ID is a reference to the component's filter, which allows to change the authoring behavior, for example by limiting which children can be added to the block or section, or which RTE features are enabled.

All of this information is stored in AEM when a block is added to a page. If either the resource type or block name are missing, the block will not render on the page.

**WARNING**: While possible, it is not necessary or recommended to implement custom AEM components. The components for Edge Delivery Services provided by AEM are sufficient and offer certain guard rails to ease development.

The components provided by AEM render a markup that can be consumed by helix-html2md when publishing to Edge Delivery Services and by `aem.js` when loading a page in the Universal Editor. The markup is the stable contract between AEM and the other parts of the system, and does not allow for customizations. For this reason, projects must not change the components and must not use custom components.

### Block structure

The properties of blocks are defined in the component models and persisted as such in AEM. Properties are rendered as cells in the block's table-like structure.

### Simple blocks

In the simplest form, a block renders each property in a single row/column in the order the properties are defined in the model.

In the following example, the image is defined first in the model and the text second. They are thus rendered with the image first and text second.

With this data:

```json
{
  "name": "Hero",
  "model": "hero",
  "image": "/content/dam/image.png",
  "imageAlt": "Helix - a shape like a corkscrew",
  "text": "<h1>Welcome to AEM</h1>"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="hero">
  <div>
    <div>
      <picture>
        <img src="/content/dam/image.png" alt="Helix - a shape like a corkscrew">
      </picture>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to AEM</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And it will be turned into this table representation:

```
+---------------------------------------------+
| Hero                                        |
+=============================================+
| ![Helix - a shape like a corkscrew][image0] |
+---------------------------------------------+
| # Welcome to AEM                            |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

You may notice that some types of values allow inferring semantics in the markup, and properties are combined into single cells. This behavior is described in the section Type inference.

### Key-value block

In many cases, it is recommended to decorate the rendered semantic markup, add CSS class names, add new nodes or move them around in the DOM, and apply styles.

In other cases however, the block is read as a key-value pair-like configuration.

An example of this is the section metadata. In this use case, the block can be configured to render as a key-value pair table. Please see the section Sections and Section Metadata for more information.

With this data:

```json
{
  "name": "Featured Articles",
  "model": "spreadsheet-input",
  "key-value": true,
  "source": "/content/site/articles.json",
  "keywords": ['Developer','Courses'],
  "limit": 4
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="featured-articles">
  <div>
    <div>source</div>
    <div><a href="/content/site/articles.json">/content/site/articles.json</a></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>keywords</div>
    <div>Developer,Courses</div>
  <div>
  <div>
    <div>limit</div>
    <div>4</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And it will be turned into this table representation:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Featured Articles                                                     |
+=======================================================================+
| source   | [/content/site/articles.json](/content/site/articles.json) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| keywords | Developer,Courses                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| limit    | 4                                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Container blocks

Both of the previous structures have a single dimension: the list of properties. Container blocks allow adding children (usually of the same type or model) and hence are two-dimensional. These blocks still support their own properties rendered as rows with a single column first. But they also allow adding children, which are rendered as additional rows.

Container blocks are defined in the same way as simple blocks, but they also define a filter ID. The filter ID references a filter definition in the `component-filters.json` file, which lists the components that can be added as children to the container.

```json
{
  "id": "cards",
  "components": [
    "card"
  ]
}
```

The following example shows a cards container block that can contain card children.

With this data:

```json
{
  "name": "Cards",
  "model": "cards",
  "filter": "cards",
  "title": "Featured Products",
  "card1": {
    "name": "Card",
    "model": "card",
    "image": "/content/dam/card1.png",
    "title": "Product 1",
    "description": "Description of product 1"
  },
  "card2": {
    "name": "Card",
    "model": "card",
    "image": "/content/dam/card2.png",
    "title": "Product 2",
    "description": "Description of product 2"
  }
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="cards">
  <div>
    <div>Featured Products</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <picture>
        <img src="/content/dam/card1.png" alt="">
      </picture>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Product 1</h3>
      <p>Description of product 1</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <picture>
        <img src="/content/dam/card2.png" alt="">
      </picture>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Product 2</h3>
      <p>Description of product 2</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And it will be turned into this table representation:

```
+---------------------------------------------+
| Cards                                       |
+=============================================+
| Featured Products                           |
+---------------------------------------------+
| ![][image0] | ### Product 1                |
|             | Description of product 1     |
+---------------------------------------------+
| ![][image1] | ### Product 2                |
|             | Description of product 2     |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

## Type inference

The system can infer the semantic meaning of certain types of values and render them accordingly. This allows for a more intuitive authoring experience and reduces the need for complex field definitions.

### Images

When a field contains a reference to an asset with the MIME type `image/*`, it is automatically rendered as a `<picture>` element with an `<img>` tag.

With this data:

```json
{
  "image": "/content/dam/hero-image.png",
  "imageAlt": "Hero image description"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<picture>
  <img src="/content/dam/hero-image.png" alt="Hero image description">
</picture>
```

### Links

When a field contains a URL or reference, it is automatically rendered as an `<a>` tag.

With this data:

```json
{
  "link": "https://www.adobe.com",
  "linkText": "Visit Adobe",
  "linkTitle": "Navigate to adobe.com"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<a href="https://www.adobe.com" title="Navigate to adobe.com">Visit Adobe</a>
```

### Rich text

When a field contains content that starts with block elements (like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<ul>`, etc.), it is automatically rendered as semantic HTML.

With this data:

```json
{
  "text": "<p>This is a paragraph with <strong>bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em>.</p>"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph with <strong>bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em>.</p>
```

### Classes

The `classes` property is a special property that can be used to specify CSS classes for the block. These classes are applied to the block element and can be used for styling variants.

With this data:

```json
{
  "name": "Hero",
  "model": "hero",
  "classes": "variant-primary full-width",
  "title": "Welcome to AEM"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="hero variant-primary full-width">
  <div>
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to AEM</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Field collapse

Field collapse is a mechanism that allows multiple related fields to be combined into a single semantic element. This is particularly useful for creating complex content structures while maintaining a simple authoring interface.

### Links

When multiple fields are related to a link (URL, text, title, type), they can be collapsed into a single link element.

With this data:

```json
{
  "link": "https://www.adobe.com",
  "linkText": "Visit Adobe",
  "linkTitle": "Navigate to adobe.com",
  "linkType": "primary"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<strong><a href="https://www.adobe.com" title="Navigate to adobe.com">Visit Adobe</a></strong>
```

The system automatically combines the fields based on their naming convention:
- `link` - the URL
- `linkText` - the display text
- `linkTitle` - the title attribute
- `linkType` - the type (affects styling)

### Headings

With this data:

```json
{
  "heading": "Getting started",
  "headingType": "h2"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<h2>Getting started</h2>
```

### Element grouping

While field collapse is about combining multiple properties into a single semantic element, element grouping is about concatenating multiple semantic elements into a single cell. This is particularly helpful for use cases where the author should be restricted in the type and number of elements that they can create.

For example, a teaser component may allow the author to only create a subtitle, title, and a single paragraph description combined with a maximum of two call-to-action buttons. Grouping these elements together yields a semantic markup that can be styled without further action.

Element grouping uses a naming convention, where the group name is separated from each property in the group by an underscore. Field collapse of the properties in a group works as previously described.

If you add a group and there is already a field that has the group name, the field will become part of the group as well, so that element grouping can be added to blocks that didn't previously use it, without having to migrate content.

With this data:

```json
{
  "name": "teaser",
  "model": "teaser",
  "image": "/content/dam/teaser-background.png",
  "imageAlt": "A group of people sitting on a stage",
  "teaserText_subtitle": "Adobe Experience Cloud",
  "teaserText_title": "Meet the Experts",
  "teaserText_titleType": "h2",
  "teaserText_description": "<p>Join us in this ask me everything session...</p>",
  "teaserText_cta1": "https://link.to/more-details",
  "teaserText_cta1Text": "More Details",
  "teaserText_cta2": "https://link.to/sign-up",
  "teaserText_cta2Text": "RSVP",
  "teaserText_cta2Type": "primary"
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="teaser">
  <div>
    <div>
      <picture>
        <img src="/content/dam/teaser-background.png" alt="A group of people sitting on a stage">
      </picture>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <p>Adobe Experience Cloud</p>
      <h2>Meet the Experts</h2>
      <p>Join us in this ask me everything session ...</p>
      <p><a href="https://link.to/more-details">More Details</a></p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://link.to/sign-up">RSVP</a></strong></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And it will be turned into this table representation:

```
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Teaser                                          |
+=================================================+
| ![A group of people sitting on a stage][image0] |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Adobe Experience Cloud                          |
| ## Meet the Experts                             |
| Join us in this ask me everything session ...   |
| [More Details](https://link.to/more-details)    |
| [RSVP](https://link.to/sign-up)                 |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

### Element Grouping for Block Options

As previously described, the `classes` property can be used to specify the block options of a block and children in a container block. Usually a select or multiselect field is used to author the block options as a single field. However, if there are multiple options and if some of them are mutually exclusive, it is easier for authors to use multiple fields to select from for individual block options. This is possible using the element grouping naming convention as described previously.

With the data:

```json
{
  "name": "teaser",
  "model": "teaser",
  "classes": "variant-a",
  "classes_background": "light",
  "classes_fullwidth": true
}
```

You get this markup:

```html
<div class="teaser variant-a light fullwidth">
  ...
</div>
```

Each field in the `classes` group can be text, an array of texts, or a boolean. In the example above, fields with a boolean value are handled slightly differently than fields with texts. For a boolean field, the property name excluding the classes group name will be added as a block option. This is particularly helpful when a toggle is used to turn a block option on or off.

## Sections and section metadata

The same way a developer can define and model multiple blocks, they can define different sections.

The content model of Edge Delivery Services deliberately allows only a single level of nesting, which is any default content or block contained by a section. This means in order to have more complex visual components that can contain other components, they have to be modelled as sections and combined together using auto-blocking client side. Typical examples of this are tabs and collapsible sections like accordions.

A section can be defined in the same way as a block, but with the resource type of `core/franklin/components/section/v1/section`. Sections can have a name and a filter ID, which are used by the Universal Editor only, as well as a model ID, which is used to render the section metadata. The model is in this way the model of the section metadata block, which will automatically be appended to a section as a key-value block if it is not empty.

The model ID and filter ID of the default section is section. It can be used to alter the behavior of the default section. The following example adds some styles and a background image to the section metadata model.

```json
{
  "id": "section",
  "fields": [
    {
      "component": "multiselect",
      "name": "style",
      "value": "",
      "label": "Style",
      "valueType": "string",
      "options": [
        {
          "name": "Fade in Background",
          "value": "fade-in"
        },
        {
          "name": "Highlight",
          "value": "highlight"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component": "reference",
      "valueType": "string",
      "name": "background",
      "label": "Image",
      "multi": false
    }
  ]
}
```

The following example defines a tab section, which can be used to create a tabs block by combining consecutive sections with a tab title data attribute into a tabs block during auto-blocking.

```json
{
  "title": "Tab",
  "id": "tab",
  "plugins": {
    "xwalk": {
      "page": {
        "resourceType": "core/franklin/components/section/v1/section",
        "template": {
          "name": "Tab",
          "model": "tab",
          "filter": "section"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Page metadata

Documents can have a page metadata block, which is used to define which `<meta>` elements are rendered in the `<head>` of a page. The page properties of pages in AEM as a Cloud Service map to those that are available out-of-the-box for Edge Delivery Services, like `title`, `description`, `keywords`, etc.

Before further exploring how to define your own metadata, please review the following documents to understand the concept of page metadata first.

* Metadata
* Bulk metadata

It is also possible to define additional page metadata in two ways.

### Metadata spreadsheets

It is possible to define metadata on a per path or per path pattern basis in a table-like way in AEM as a Cloud Service. There is an authoring UI for table-like data available that is similar to Excel or Google Sheets.

For further details, please see the document Using Spreadsheets to Manage Tabular Data for more information.

### Page properties

Many of the default page properties available in AEM are mapped to the respective page metadata in a document. That includes for example `title`, `description`, `robots`, `canonical` `url` or `keywords`. Some AEM-specific properties are available as well:

* `cq:lastModified` as modified-time in ISO8601 format
* The time the document was last published as `published-time` in ISO8601 format
* `cq:tags` as `cq-tags` as a comma-separated list of the tag IDs.

It is also possible to define a component model for custom page metadata, which will be made available to the author in the Universal Editor.

To do so, create a component model with the ID page-metadata.

```json
{
  "id": "page-metadata",
  "fields": [
    {
      "component": "text",
      "name": "theme",
      "label": "Theme"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also create component models per template. To do so, create entries named `<template>-metadata`, with `template` being the value stored in the template metadata property. For details on metadata, please see the document Metadata Block.
